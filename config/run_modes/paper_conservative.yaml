max_exposure_per_league: 0.15   # 15% per league
max_gross_exposure: 0.50        # 50% max deployed

# Edge Thresholds
min_edge_threshold: 0.02    # 2% minimum edge (higher threshold = fewer trades)

high_confidence_edge: 0.06  # 6%+ is high confidence

# Drawdown Throttle Bands
# When drawdown reaches threshold, sizing is multiplied by this factor
drawdown_bands:
  - threshold: 0.03   # 0-3% drawdown
    multiplier: 1.0   # 100% sizing
  - threshold: 0.06   # 3-6% drawdown
    multiplier: 0.6   # 60% sizing
  - threshold: 0.10   # 6-10% drawdown
    multiplier: 0.2   # 20% sizing

# Pacing Parameters
# Controls how aggressive the agent is based on progress toward target
pacing:
  behind_threshold: 0.7   # Behind pace if <70% of target
  ahead_threshold: 1.5    # Ahead of pace if >150% of target
  max_multiplier: 1.3     # Max 30% boost when behind
  min_multiplier: 0.8     # 20% reduction when ahead

# Time to Kickoff Adjustments
# Discount edge based on time until match starts
time_to_kickoff:
  very_early_discount: 0.35  # >48h: 35% discount
  early_discount: 0.20       # 24-48h: 20% discount
