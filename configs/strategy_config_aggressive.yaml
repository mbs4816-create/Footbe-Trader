# Aggressive Strategy Configuration
# Targets: 10-12% daily returns, 20% max drawdown
# HIGH RISK - Uses leverage sizing and wider acceptance criteria

# Edge thresholds (LOWERED for more volume)
# NOTE: Using placeholder model (home advantage prior only), so edges are minimal
# Real model integration needed for better edge detection
edge:
  min_edge_to_enter: 0.005  # 0.5% edge (VERY aggressive - placeholder model only)
  exit_edge_buffer: -0.05  # Hold until -5% edge
  min_model_confidence: 0.45  # Lower confidence threshold

# Liquidity requirements (MORE RELAXED for more opportunities)
liquidity:
  min_ask_volume: 5  # Accept thinner markets
  min_bid_volume: 5
  max_spread: 0.60  # 60 cents - accept wide spreads

# Position sizing (AGGRESSIVE Kelly)

  max_exposure_per_fixture: 60.0  # $60 per fixture (adjusted for $127 bankroll)
  max_global_exposure: 150.0  # $150 total exposure (adjusted for $127 bankroll)
  initial_bankroll: 127.0  # Match actual starting bankroll

# Exit rules (TIGHTER for quick profits)

  take_profit: 0.08  # 8 cents profit (faster exits)
  stop_loss: 0.15  # 15 cents loss (tighter stops)

# Market filtering (MORE PERMISSIVE)
