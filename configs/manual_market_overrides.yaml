# Manual Market Overrides Configuration
# Use this file to manually specify fixture-to-market mappings
# when automatic mapping fails or produces incorrect results.

# Format options:
# 1. By fixture_id (API-Football fixture ID):
#    fixture_<id>:
#      event_ticker: "KALSHI_EVENT_TICKER"
#      ticker_home_win: "TICKER_H"
#      ticker_draw: "TICKER_D"  # optional
#      ticker_away_win: "TICKER_A"
#      structure_type: "1X2" | "NO_DRAW" | "HOME_WIN_BINARY" | "AWAY_WIN_BINARY"
#      notes: "Optional notes about this override"
#
# 2. By teams + kickoff (for fixtures not yet in DB):
#    match_<id>:
#      home_team: "canonical team name"
#      away_team: "canonical team name"
#      kickoff_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # UTC date
#      event_ticker: "KALSHI_EVENT_TICKER"
#      ticker_home_win: "TICKER_H"
#      ticker_draw: "TICKER_D"
#      ticker_away_win: "TICKER_A"
#      structure_type: "1X2"
#      notes: "Optional notes"
